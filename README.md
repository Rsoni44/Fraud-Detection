# Fraud-Detection
Analysis-Feature Extraction-Training-Modelling


In this project, we propose a credit card fraud detection system based on conventional machine learning techniques as well as Deep Learning algorithms to predict the fraudulent behaviour of credit card transactions and deliver good fraud detection performance. We provide the experimental results to validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Algorithms Used :

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Classification using RBF Kernel
LSTM
Attention based neural network
Autoencoders
